"Let Us Loot The Chambers of God's Heart" is an early-modern alchemical fantasy setting, which I am using for fiction and roleplaying games.

The main object is to create a setting that's in flux, rife with conflict and contradiction. God has just died, no longer hefting her bucket, but the Thousand Rose Empire is eager to take Her place. What fate awaits the humans, jellies and homunculi in the new world that is, for now, but a gleam in an alchemist's eye?
